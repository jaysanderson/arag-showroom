# Exercise 3 — Create a custom extraction config through the API and the UI

**Time budget:** 10 minutes.
**Matches:** LAB.md Section 3. Needs `ADMIN_TOKEN` set (Section 0) and a session
cookie for the write calls (see the hint below).

## Task

Create a custom extraction config called `"Vehicle Registration"` with three fields —
`Plate Number` (required), `Owner Name`, and `Registration Expiry` — once through the
API and once through the demo UI, then inspect the ARAG search configuration the second
one provisions using the admin API.

1. `POST /api/v1/extraction-configs` with the fields above. Note the returned
   `id` and `aragConfig`.
2. Upload `public/samples/invoice.txt` (or any sample) with `?config=<your id>` and
   confirm `meta.config` on the resulting record reads `"Vehicle Registration"`.
3. Open the demo UI and recreate the same config by hand through the config manager
   form. Confirm it appears in the config selector's "Custom" group immediately.
4. Call `GET /api/v1/admin/search-configurations` (admin-gated) and find your second
   config's entry by its `aragConfig` name. Identify, in the `config` object, which
   field controls the RAG grounding strategy and which field is the JSON Schema the
   model is forced to fill.
5. Delete both configs you created (`DELETE /api/v1/extraction-configs/{id}`) and
   confirm a built-in (e.g. `invoice`) refuses deletion with `409`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The `POST` response has `provisioned: true` without any separate "provision" call.
- [ ] The forced upload's record has `meta.forced: true` and `meta.config: "Vehicle Registration"`.
- [ ] The config created through the UI is visible in `GET /api/v1/extraction-configs`
      immediately after saving, with `builtin: false`.
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/admin/search-configurations`'s matching item has a
      `config.rag_strategies` array containing `{ "name": "full_resource" }` and a
      `config.answer_json_schema.parameters.properties` object with exactly your three
      (snake_case) field keys.
- [ ] Both custom configs are deleted by the end of the exercise, and
      `DELETE /api/v1/extraction-configs/invoice` returns `409`.

## Hints

- Field keys are derived from labels automatically (`toKey` in `schemas.ts`) unless you
  pass an explicit `key` — `"Plate Number"` becomes `plate_number`.
- The config id for a custom config always starts with `cfg_`; built-in ids are the doc
  type itself (e.g. `invoice`).
- Creating and deleting a config are writes to shared state, so — unlike a plain
  document upload — they require a credential even when `API_KEYS` is unset:
  `POST /api/v1/session` once, and send the resulting cookie back on the `POST`/`DELETE`
  calls (`curl -c cookies.txt` then `-b cookies.txt`). `GET /api/v1/admin/search-configurations`
  is a *different* gate — it needs the admin credential (`Authorization: Bearer
  <ADMIN_TOKEN>`), not just a session.
- The UI's config manager talks to the exact same `/api/v1/extraction-configs` endpoint
  as `curl` — there is no separate "UI-only" code path to inspect.
- `aragConfig` is deterministic: `dip_custom_<slugified name>` for a custom config,
  `dip_<schema name>` for a built-in.

If you get stuck, [`solutions/03-custom-extraction-config.md`](../solutions/03-custom-extraction-config.md) has the exact commands, the
UI steps, and the real admin API output.
